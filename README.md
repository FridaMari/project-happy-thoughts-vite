# Happy thoughts Project

In this solo project we practise React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

Started by sketching out the different components and the structure of the app. After that I started fetching data from the API endpoint and broke out what value goes in what component, and passed them using props. useEffect and useState made made it convinient to update and render the new values in the UI.
